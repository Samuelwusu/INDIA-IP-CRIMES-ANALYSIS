# IPC CRIME ANALYSIS REPORT (2001-2013)
This report analyzes IPC( Indian Penal Code) crime data from 2001-2013 across multiple states in India. The dashboard built from the dataset highlights overall crime volumes, population differences, state-level crime rates, crime type distributions, and year-by-year trends.
To ensure fairness in comparison, the analysis focuses not only on total crime counts but also on average crime rate per state, which adjusts for population differences.

1. **DATASET OVERVIEW**
* **Dataset Range**: 2001-2013
* **Scope**: IPC crimes recorded by Indian states
* **Metrics used**:

  2. Population by states
  3. Average crime rate per state (calculated across all available years)
  4. Crime type breakdown for for Kerala State
  5. Yearly Crime trends 

2. **KEY FINDINGS**

2.1 **Total Crimes vs Population**
* The state with the highest total crime count in the dataset is india (overall),but this is expected because it also has the largest population in the dataset.
* Because total crime alone can be misleading, the analysis shifted to average crime rate per state to get a clear picture.

2.2 **Average crime Rate by State**
* **Puducherry** showed the highest average crime rate but only one year of data was available for this state.
* Due to limited data for Puducherry, the next most reliable measure was the state with the highest average crime rate across multiple years.
* That state was **KERALA**, which consistently showed the highest average crime rate during the dataset period.
