# IPC CRIME ANALYSIS REPORT (2001-2013)
This report analyzes IPC( Indian Penal Code) crime data from 2001-2013 across multiple states in India. The dashboard built from the dataset highlights overall crime volumes, population differences, state-level crime rates, crime type distributions, and year-by-year trends.
To ensure fairness in comparison, the analysis focuses not only on total crime counts but also on average crime rate per state, which adjusts for population differences.

1. **DATASET OVERVIEW**
* **Dataset Range**: 2001-2013
* **Scope**: IPC crimes recorded by Indian states
* **Metrics used**:
  1. Total crime count
  2. Population by states
  3. Average crime rate per state (calculated across all available years)
  4. Crime type breakdown for for Kerala State
  5. Yearly Crime trends 

2. **KEY FINDINGS**

2.1 **Total Crimes vs Population**
* The state with the highest total crime count in the dataset is india (overall),but this is expected because it also has the largest population in the dataset.
* Because total crime alone can be misleading, the analysis shifted to average crime rate per state to get a clear picture.

2.2 **Average crime Rate by State**
* **Puducherry** showed the highest average crime rate but only one year of data was available for this state.
* Due to limited data for Puducherry, the next most reliable measure was the state with the highest average crime rate across multiple years.
* That state was **KERALA**, which consistently showed the highest average crime rate during the dataset period.

* **.3 Trends in Kerala(2001-2013)**
* Based on the year-by-year line chart:
* Crime levels in Kerala remained relatively low from 2001-2007.
* **2008**: Crime began to rise noticeably.
* **2011**: Crime reached its **peak**.
* **2012**: Crime declined a bit a temporary improvement.
* **2013** Crime rose again, exceeding even the 2011 peak.

* **Interpretation**:
* Kerala experienced a temporary improvement in 2012, suggesting that some intervention or change during that period helped reduce crime, but the effect was not sustained in 2013.

* **2.4 Crime-Type Distribution in Kerala**
* Based on the Kerala crime composition pie chart:
* 1. 56% of crimes fall under **OTHER IPC CRIMES**(category not explicitly defined in the dataset).
  2. 15% come from Grievious Hurt, making it the second major crime type.
  3. The remaining crime types make up smaller portions of the total.
 These two categories alone make up 71% of Kerala's total crimes in the dataset.
  
  **DASHBOARD VISUALS USED**
  The following Visuals were included in the dashboard to support the analysis:
  1. **Bar Chart** Total IPC Crimes by state shows overallcrime volume across states.
  2. **Clustered Column Chart** Population by state, Used to compare crime volume against population size.
  3. **Clustered Column Chart** Top 10 state by Average Crime Rate, Highlights Kerala ( and Puducherry, though limited data) as highest.
  4. **Pie Chart** Percentage of Each Crime Type in Kerala, Shows which crimes dominate Kerala's crime profile.
  5. **Line Chart** Year Count By States, Displays dataset coverage over time.
  6. **Line Chart** Trend of IPC Crimes by State (2001-2013), Used specifically to understand Kerala's crime trend over time.
  7. **Slicer** To help Navigate all the charts on the dashboard for easy explanation.
 
  **4. Conclusions**

  The analysis demonstrates that:
  1. Total Crime count does not reflect true risk because it is heavily influenced by population size.
  2. Kerala is the most concerning state when focusing on average crime rate, based on consistent data.
  3. Kerala's Crime trend suggests an  uncontrolled rise, with only a temporary improvement in 2012.
  4. Crime types are heavily dominated by "other IPC Crimes" and "Grevious Hurt", which together account for most incidents.

   **5. Recommendations**
  Based on my findings through my dashboard:
  1. Reinstate practices from 2012, Whatever interventions contributed to the decline in 2012 should be analyzed and repeated, since they produced a clear temporary improvement.
  2. Prioritize monitoring of "Grievous Hurt" incidents. As the second largest known category (15%), reducing these crimes would noticeably improve Kerala's overal safety levels.
  3. Investigate "Other IPC Crimes" further, Since this category accounts for 56% of all crimes but is not clearly defind, deeper classification or better reporting would make future analysis more effective.
